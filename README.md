# Typst-CV
This Typst CV template is inspired by Latex template [Deedy-Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume).

This can only be used under macOS because of the font. If you want to use it on other platforms, you need to change the font.

In original Typst, we cannot create a reference list withou citation. So I modified the code for this purpose. Currently, I only create the Chicago style citation and reference list. If you want to use other citation styles, you need to modify the code.

**remember: you need to use `json` file exported from Zotero with BetterBibTeX. I did not test other ways.**

## Todo
Create more citation styles for citations.
